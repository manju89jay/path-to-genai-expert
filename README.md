# Path to GenAI Expert

A curated, topic-first learning path to take me from AI fundamentals to leading production-grade AI projects. Each module combines focused study with a real-world demo that proves out the concepts and captures measurable outcomes (latency, cost, accuracy).

## How this repository is organized
- **Vision** – why this roadmap exists and the kind of expert I aim to become.
- **Learning path** – the ordered list of modules. Every row explains the key skills and gives me a space to link the demo project that showcases them.
- **How to use** – a repeatable workflow for working through the material and building demos.

## Vision: build, measure, lead
1. Develop strong theoretical footing in generative AI and adjacent disciplines.
2. Ship hands-on demos that solve real problems and document the metrics that matter.
3. Grow the collection into a portfolio that demonstrates leadership in AI delivery.

> **Tip:** Keep each demo small but production-minded—add telemetry, track budget, and note trade-offs.

## How to use this roadmap
1. **Review the module overview.** Skim the curated resources and choose one primary source to study deeply.
2. **Design a demo.** Pick a real-world problem, scope it to a weekend project, and define success metrics.
3. **Build and document.** Implement the demo, record latency/cost/quality numbers, and link the repo or notebook in the table above.
4. **Reflect and iterate.** Write down lessons learned, gaps to fill, and ideas for the next module.
