# AI Engineering Portfolio — Simple Roadmap

A lightweight, topic-first roadmap to learn and showcase essential AI engineering skills—no timeline, just the core areas and the best resources. See **ROADMAP.md** for details.

## Why this repo
- Stay focused on essentials (agents, RAG, evals, serving, safety).
- Add small demos as you learn (one folder per topic).
- Keep decisions visible via short notes in each demo.

## How to use
1. Pick a topic from the roadmap.
2. Choose **one primary resource** and **one main tool**.
3. Build a tiny demo; record key metrics (latency, cost, accuracy).
4. Add a brief `README.md` inside the demo folder with lessons learned.
