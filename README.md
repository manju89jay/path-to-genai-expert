# AI Engineering Curriculum (AIFB-style) — gpt-5-codex

A clear, topic-first curriculum inspired by the style of **AI-For-Beginners**. Short modules, hands-on labs, and space to link **my own projects** next to each topic.

> Tip: Pick one primary resource per module, build a small demo, and record key metrics (latency/cost/accuracy) in your project README.

## Learning Path (beginner → production)

| 09 | [Security & Safety](curriculum/09-security-safety/README.md) | prompt injection, insecure output handling, permissions | *(add link)* |
| 10 | [Governance & Compliance](curriculum/10-governance-compliance/README.md) | NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act basics, model cards | *(add link)* |
| 11 | [Edge & Embedded (Optional)](curriculum/11-edge-embedded/README.md) | SLMs on-device, offline modes, tests | *(add link)* |
| 12 | [Portfolio Patterns](curriculum/12-portfolio-patterns/README.md) | small demos that prove skills with metrics | *(add link)* |

## How to use
1. Open a module, read the short overview, and pick **one** primary resource.
2. Build a tiny demo; link it back in this table under **My project**.
3. Capture lessons learned and numbers (latency/cost/accuracy).
