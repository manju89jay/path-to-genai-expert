# AI Leadership & Automation Roadmap (1 Year)

Track my AI learning and project leadership journey. This repo holds the **roadmap**, **resources**, **weekly logs**, **ADRs**, and **lightweight CI** so I never lose history.

## Quickstart
- Add weekly notes in `logs/week-XX.md` (use `_TEMPLATE_WEEKLY.md`).
- Update checkboxes in `ROADMAP.md` each Friday.
- Add resources to `RESOURCES.md` → PR for traceable history.

## Structure
- `ROADMAP.md` — quarterly plan, KPIs, milestones
- `RESOURCES.md` — curated links by topic
- `logs/` — weekly logs + auto index
- `docs/adrs/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `.github/` — PR/Issue templates, CI
- `scripts/` — helper scripts

## Why this exists
- **Durable history:** PRs + changelog capture decisions and progress.
- **Lead AI projects:** links + templates + evals make it production-minded.
