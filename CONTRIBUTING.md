# Contributing Guide

Thank you for helping grow *Path to GenAI Expert*! This project aims to be a living curriculum that balances hands-on builds, governance rigor, and leadership skills. Please follow the guidelines below to keep contributions consistent and high quality.

## How to Propose Updates
1. **Open an issue first.** Describe the improvement (new resource, module update, template fix) and link to any references.
2. **Fork and branch.** Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/new-rag-resource`) and keep changes focused.
3. **Add evidence.** When adding or updating resources, include why they matter, estimated time, and proof that links work.
4. **Run checks.** Validate that Markdown renders, links resolve, and templates remain copy-paste ready.
5. **Submit a PR.** Fill out the pull request template (coming soon) and link the issue you opened. Expect review feedback within a few days.

## Style Rules
- Follow the tone of the README: concise, pragmatic, leadership-aware.
- Use active voice, actionable verbs, and inclusive language.
- Keep Markdown headings to three levels deep within README modules.
- Tables should include: Resource, Format, Level, Estimated Time, and Why it matters.
- Add a **Mini-task** and an `<!-- TODO: Extend later -->` block for every new section.

## Resource Quality Bar
- Prefer official documentation, reputable courses, or well-maintained open-source repos updated within the last 18 months.
- Avoid paywalled resources unless a generous free tier exists—mark any costs clearly.
- Link-check before submission and include a short justification (1–2 sentences) explaining why the resource is valuable.
- Do not duplicate resources already listed elsewhere in the curriculum.

## Pull Request Checklist
